Installation
------------

See redmine plugin installation howto.

This plugin does not modify the database.

Required
--------

Redmine 1.3.0 later

Documentation
-------------

To include a repository file and format it:

-------------------------------
{{repo_include(file_path)}} <1>

{{repo_include(file_path, revision)}}

{{repo_includewiki(file_path)}} <2>

{{repo_includemd(file_path)}} <3>

{{repo_includecode(file_path, language, revision)}} <4>
-------------------------------

<1> +file_path+ is the file to include.

<2> Format the file as Textile.

<3> Format the file as Markdown.

<4> Syntax highlighting

TODO
----

The macro must be extended for controlling if the Wiki format is applied or not.
Moreover a code block could be also used for code inclusion. Maybe those options
should be added by using another macro name.

Example of additional feature:

-----------------------------------------------
{{repo_include(file_path, revision, is_block)}}
-----------------------------------------------

Known Issues
------------

None.

Notes
-----

This plugin is very simple. It SHOULD be enhanced by adding new macros and by
improving the first one.
